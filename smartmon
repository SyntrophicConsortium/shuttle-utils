# Smartmon - S.M.A.R.T. Diagnostic Info Push Notifier - v1.0
# 	by Andy Forceno <andy@aurorabox.tech>
#
# Checks SMART info for disks on remote hosts and pushes info to a device

# It is recommeneded to run this daily via cron (as root user)
# And run the long test weekly (see smartmon_long)
# You will need passwordless-sudo on the remote devices to automate this script

# Device to send push notifications to
device="phone"

# Drive to scan
# Currently only supports a single drive
drive="/dev/sda"

# User to send reports to 
mailto="root@aurorabox"

# Location of local disk copy of repo
BASEDIR="$HOME/scripts/bin"

# Check if hosts are available before running remote SMART tests
source "$BASEDIR"/hosts_check

# Remove Host from hosts array, it has no hard disks
# HOSTS=($(echo "${HOSTS[@]}" | sed -e "s/Hostname//g"))

# Iterate through hosts list
for j in "${HOSTS[@]}"; do
echo -e "$0: SMART Test for host: $j"
	smart_test=$(ssh "$j" "sudo smartctl -a $drive")
	smart_result=$(echo "$smart_test" | head -n30 | grep "overall-health" | awk -F': ' '{ print $2 }')
echo -e "$0: $smart_result"
# Only notify if test fails so we don't swamp the poor sys admin
	if [[ -n "$smart_result" && "$smart_result" != "PASSED" ]]; then
